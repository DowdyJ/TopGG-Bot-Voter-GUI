# TopGG Bot Voter GUI
This is a simple GUI for the Top-GG-Bot-Voter application written with React Native for Web. This aims to provide greater ease-of-use for the bot voter solution.
It should only be used in conjunction with the [API Server](https://github.com/DowdyJ/TopGG-Bot-Voter-API-Server) and the [backend application](https://github.com/DowdyJ/TopGG-Bot-Voter).

## Installation
The solution works on both Windows and Linux.
You will need Node.js 18.0 or higher installed. You can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current). **You must use Node 18.0 or above**!

Now, to install:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Extract the folder (if necessary) and open a new terminal in the folder with this README
3. Run the command, `npm install` to install all dependencies for this project.

To run the project:
1. Open a terminal in the folder with node_modules
2. Run `npx expo start`
3. After it finishes loading, it should instruct you to press "w" to open a web view. Press "w" as instructed.
4. A new browser tab should be opened automatically. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:19006`

If the API Server is running an configured correctly, you should be able to control the bot voter application from the new tab.
